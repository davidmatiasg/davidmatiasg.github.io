I am a PhD Student in Economics at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) and a Graduate Student Fellow at the [Baker Institute’s Center for Energy Studies](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/expert/david-matias-garcia). My research focuses on Industrial Organization and Energy Markets.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked for three years at the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en)  as an energy economist. I also hold a Master’s in Economics from [El Colegio de México (COLMEX)](https://www.colmex.mx/) and a Bachelor’s degree from the [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)](https://www.unam.mx/) .
