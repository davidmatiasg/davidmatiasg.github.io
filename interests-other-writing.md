## Book reviews

I am currently reading several books. While I previously explored a wide range of genres, my focus has recently shifted toward personal growth literature. Because I often struggle to retain specific insights and remember which author said what, I created this page to share brief reviews. This platform serves as both a public resource and a personal accountability tool. As a personal goal, I will try to read at least one book per month and share a meaningful takeaway from each one.

2026
- Greek Lessons — Han Kang (January 2026)
> *Fragments of memory shift and form shapes. They do so without pattern, without plan, without any meaning at all.*  
> *They scatter, and then—suddenly—gather again with resolve.*  
> *They resemble countless butterflies going still all at once; they resemble impassive dancers with their faces covered.*  
> — Han Kang, *Greek Lessons*, p. xx. *(my translation from the Spanish excerpt)*

What moves me about this fragment is how precisely it mirrors human thought. Memory doesn’t arrive in a straight line: it drifts, disappears, returns—sometimes without warning, sometimes with force. I’ll be doing something ordinary and a scene from my past will surface, vivid for a moment, then dissolve, only to reappear later in a different shape. That happens with simple family memories and with more complicated experiences I’ve lived through.

This book captures something essential: our present is often the result of fragments we can’t fully control, stitched together by habit, emotion, and time. It reminds me that everyone is carrying a private archive—moments that explain their silences, their reactions, their fears, their tenderness. If we remembered that more often, we’d be gentler with each other. We don’t know what someone has survived, or what keeps returning to them when we’re not looking.
