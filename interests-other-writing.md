My opinions are my own.

## Book reviews

I am currently reading several books. While I previously explored a wide range of genres, my focus has recently shifted toward personal growth literature. Because I often struggle to retain specific insights and authorship details, I created this page to share brief reviews. This platform serves as both a public resource and a personal accountability tool.

- Dark academe — Jeffrey R. Di Leo  
- Hillbilly elegy — JD Vance  
- The charisma myth — Olivia Fox Cabane  
- The coming wave — Mustafa Suleyman  
- The growth story of the 21st century — Nicholas Stern  
- The joy of living — Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche

## Food reviews

I recently relocated to Houston, a city renowned for its culinary diversity and authentic international restaurants. Having previously lived in Mexico City and Washington, D.C., I have maintained a long standing habit of exploring new cuisines during weekends. To mitigate the loss of detail over time and to provide a public resource, I have decided to document these experiences. These reviews serve as a personal archive and a guide for others seeking high quality dining options.
